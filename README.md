# Cadence-Design-Systems-2A-AI-Studio-Project
#### The goal of this project is to develop an AI system that automatically extracts product features from Amazon large-scale product review dataset, performs sentiment analysis for each feature, prioritizes issues based on their frequency and severity and generates recommendations for which features to preserve and which to redesign. Building on this analysis, we will create an AI-powered dashboard that enables product teams to efficiently extract actionable insights from thousands of customer reviews, providing clear guidance for product development and improvement.

## Milestone 1. Data Exploration & Preprocessing
### Data Loading and Cleaning
#### There are 34 product categories and for each category, there are 2 json files: review and meta in each category. Since we have to extract all customer review contents, we merged review and meta data for every category and combine all categories in a DataFrame.

## Milestone 2. Model Development & Deployment
